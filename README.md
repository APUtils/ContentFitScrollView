Self adjustable Scroll View that proportionally reducing provided height constraints constants to fit all content on screen without scrolling. It takes into account `ContentFitLayoutConstraint`'s `minimumHeight` value. If it's unable to fit content on screen without scrolling it'll just allow scrolling.

`ContentFitScrollView` allows you to layout your content for high resolution screens and be sure that in case there isn't enough space on lower resolution screens content will be scrollable.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

<img src="Example/ContentFitScrollView/ContentFitScrollViewStoryboardClass.png"/>

and add constraints that you want to be resized in order to fit content for screen:
